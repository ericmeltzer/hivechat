Hivechat requires NowJS, which can be found at http://nowjs.com/.  People with npm can just type "npm install now"

To run the server, just type "node hivechat.js"  

The server will run by default on port 8080. 

If you're having any trouble, have some suggestions, or need help, drop me a note: hivechat@ericmeltzer.org

Enjoy!
